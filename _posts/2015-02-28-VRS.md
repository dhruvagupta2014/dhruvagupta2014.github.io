Deep Learning is making waves in a lot of areas today. A lot of industry use cases are getting disrupted in the sense that traditional approaches are being replaced by Machine Learning/Deep Learning approaches. I think a major catalyst is the concept of Open Source. Deep Learning libraries like Tensorflow, Caffe, Pytorch etc have given the reigns of a highly academic field to Software developers.

In this post I’ll show you how you can leverage the power of such open source tools to make a Visual Recommender System. There are multiple use cases for this, but just to take an example, let’s say you went out for shopping with friends and loved a blue dress which is priced way over what you want to pay for. Well, you can go online and search for dresses similar to this blue dress which is within your budget using the Visual Recommender System(VRS). We’re going to utilize a popular concept called Transfer Learning to build the VRS . So, what is Transfer Learning ?

In short, and in the context of images, a Deep Learning model is a layered architecture and can be designed to perform various tasks on a dataset. For eg. Classifying which animal an image contains. (this task is also called ‘classification’). There are other tasks possible, like speech recognition, stock market predictions etc.

Different layers learn different things about the data. For eg. If your data is a set of images of animals, the initial few layers might learn to identify very low level features of the images, for eg. the colors, edges, contours (note that these features are general to any kind of image) etc while the intermediate layers might learn to identify features more specific to our data (animals in our case) like whether there’s a tail or not, or whether the current image has an animal which is 4 legged like a lion or two legged like a kangaroo etc. The final layer can tell us which animal it is (if the deep learning model is designed to perform classification).

Note that the above Deep Learning model was only trained on animals so even the low level features like colors or edges might be specific to animals. But if your model is trained on a huge dataset of millions of images from everyday life like cars, fruits, highways, people etc. then the initial few layers would learn to extract these generic low level building blocks like edges, contours, colors, shapes which remain the same for any kind of image (since all images are made of more or less the same basic building blocks). These low level features learned by the thus trained model can be re-used so as to save valuable time and also lets the model train by relatively smaller dataset.  This is the basis of transfer learning.

**Here is some bold text**

#Here's a useless table:

How about a yummy crepe?

![Crepe](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg)

It can also be centered!

![Crepe](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg){: .center-block :}

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.
